                <h3>What does my BuzzChat profile show others?</h3>
                <p>Your profile displays your name, username, profile picture (optional), number of posts ("Buzzes"), number of people you follow ("Connections"), and number of followers ("Connected"). It's your digital identity on BuzzChat!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How do I connect with friends and others on BuzzChat?</h3>
                <p>There are three main ways to connect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Invite your friends:</strong> Share your username or a link to your profile. They can then search for you and initiate a connection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Through search:</strong> Use the search bar to find people by their name, username, email address, or phone number (if you have it).</li>
                    <li><strong>Through likes and shared interests:</strong> Connect with people who like your posts and engage with content that resonates with you.</li>

            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What's the timeline all about?</h3>
                <p>The timeline is your personalized feed showing posts from people you connect with. It's where you stay updated on their activities, share your thoughts, engage in conversations, and build relationships within the BuzzChat community. Think of it as your central hub for connection and interaction.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How do I create a post on BuzzChat?</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to your timeline and tap the round blue button in the lower right corner.</li>
                    <li>Type your message in the text box. You have a character limit that can be increased by earning Buzz Bucks (more on that later!).</li>
                    <li>Express yourself freely but remember to be respectful and avoid offensive language. Our AI Moderation system ensures a safe and positive environment for everyone.</li>
                    <li>Want to add more than just text? Use the three interactive buttons to upload photos, videos, or GIFs to make your posts even more engaging.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What if I need inspiration for a post?</h3>
                <p>BuzzChat has you covered! Our AI-powered content generator can help you craft the perfect post. Just provide a brief description of what you want to say or the kind of image you have in mind, and our AI will work its magic. You can even select the tone of your message (Formal, Casual, Confident, Humorous) to match your style.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What are the different ways I can interact with a post?</h3>
                <p>Here are five ways to engage with posts you find interesting:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Like:</strong> Tap the heart icon to show your appreciation for a post. Tap again to unlike.</li>
                    <li><strong>Comment:</strong> Share your thoughts, opinions, or questions in the comments section. You can also use this to report any concerns to our moderators.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rebuzz:</strong> Like something you see? Use the arrows button to instantly share the post on your timeline and with your connections.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fact Check:</strong> Not sure about the accuracy of a post? Tap the bulb icon to initiate a fact-check.</li>
                    <li><strong>More Menu:</strong> The three horizontal dots in the upper right corner of a post give you more options like copying the post, reporting it, sharing it outside BuzzChat, saving it to your bookmarks, and viewing the number of likes it has received.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I see who viewed my post?</h3>
                <p>The eye logo button on your post shows the total number of views, but it doesn't reveal the identity of those viewers. Your privacy matters to us!</p>
